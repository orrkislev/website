    <subtitle>How did you make that?</subtitle>

    <content>
        I followed Daniel Shiffman's coding challange about marbling. You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifChJ0nJfM" target="_blank">here</a>.
        and then I added some features to it.

    <subtitle>Draw -> Plot</subtitle>

    <content>
        You can draw on the canvas with the mouse, dropping the ink.
        hit 's' to save the drawing as an svg file.
        And then you can plot the drawing with a pen plotter.
