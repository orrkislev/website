<h2>this sketch draws a bunch of friendly friends, they get pushed upward as more and more friends join the party</h2>

<p>each friend is a circle with eyes, and they are being pushed around by more circles, calculated by the matter.js physics engine, and drawn using p5js circle() function</p>

<p>as the canvas does not clear itself, the friends leave a trail behind them, making them look snake-like</p>

<p>
TRY: try adding a background at the beginning of the draw function to remove the trails of the friends, and see how it looks
TRY: try changing the colors of the friends, or the eyes, or the background
TRY: try changing the physics engine parameters, like gravity or restitution
TRY: try adding more friends, or changing their size or the force applied to them
TRY: try constraining the friends' movement to a certain area, like a box or a circle

?? what would make them form a flower? or a spiral? or a heart? or a tree?
?? what happens if similar colors are attracted to each other, and different colors repel each other?
