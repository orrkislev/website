<div>this sketch demonstrates the dithering technique. 
    the image is ditheres using the error diffusion method.
    for every channel (r, g, b) the pixel value is quantized to 0 or 255.
    the error is then diffused to the neighboring pixels.
    the error is diffused in the following way:
    <pre>
    7/16 1/16
    3/16 5/16 1/16
    </pre>

    the image is then displayed in the canvas.
