<h1>Network Growth Visualization</h1>
<p>This code creates an interactive visualization of a growing network. It uses p5.js for graphics and Matter.js for physics simulation.</p>
<p>The network consists of circles (vertices) connected by lines. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking the mouse adds a new circle at that location.</li>
  <li>Every few frames, the network grows automatically:
    <ul>
      <li>It selects an existing circle</li>
      <li>Creates a new circle nearby</li>
      <li>Connects them with a line</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The network moves dynamically due to simulated physics</li>
  <li>Circles with only one connection are drawn slightly larger</li>
  <li>Pressing the spacebar pauses or resumes the animation</li>
</ul>
<p>The code handles drawing, growth logic, and physics interactions. It creates a dynamic, expanding network structure that responds to user input and evolves over time.</p>
